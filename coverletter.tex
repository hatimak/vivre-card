\begin{cvletter}

% \lettersection{EN}{}{%
% Climate change is the defining crisis of our age, and its impact is visible across geographical and social communities. The key is looking for solutions in the research areas, such as intelligent control \& measurement, grid automation, and high-performance modelling \& simulation. Since research at ACS widely covers this domain, I am strongly motivated to apply for the position of PhD research assistant at ACS.

\lettersection{EN}{}{%
The role of a PhD research assistant requires a sustained level of independent and structured productivity, creative thinking and effective communication. I have demonstrated these abilities in my previous academic experience during my Bachelor's and Master's theses. My supervisors appreciate my ability to weigh precisely which decision option is best, and this approach has often prevented unpleasant surprises and ensured deliverables within deadlines. I believe I can combine traditional expertise with creative thinking to come up with entirely new problem-solving ideas. I am strongly motivated to apply for the position of PhD research assistant at ACS.

\lettersection{EN}{}{%
As a Master's student in the M.\,Sc. Electrical Engineering course at RWTH, I have attended several classes taught by Prof. Monti and Prof. Ponci. I was also employed as a HiWi at ACS for 16 months, and soon after, I wrote my Master's thesis also at ACS. Throughout my term at ACS, I was involved in developing FPGA systems for real-time simulations in various capacities. I helped integrate Xilinx FPGA boards into the VILLAS co-simulation platform. I engineered a Tcl-Makefile system of scripts and developed bare-metal driver programs. These experiences finally culminated in my "FPGA-based Real-Time Control and Simulation" thesis, where I propose and describe the use of a heterogenous soft-core microprocessor architecture to prototype control-loop algorithms for FPGA-based real-time simulators.

\lettersection{EN}{}{%
I believe I would be a suitable candidate for a PhD research assistant at ACS, E.ON ERC, RWTH Aachen University. I can identify the significant challenges that might arise throughout this journey, and I believe I have demonstrated an ability to mitigate these challenges. With my previous long-term relationship with ACS in various capacities, I could comfortably fit into the institute's cultural and international atmosphere. I believe that with the unique combination of all these elements, I could get started smoothly and focus on the exciting challenges ahead.
