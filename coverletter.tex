\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a Master's graduate from the RWTH Aachen University and a Bachelor's graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India. My professional interests lie at the intersection of embedded computing, electrical engineering, control systems and communication engineering; the intra-disciplinary application of these concepts to solving real-world problems is a strong motivation for me. I pride myself on being a quick and independent learner who is often among those who ask a lot of curious questions. My academic and professional journey has been an enriching experience reflecting my ability to collaborate with colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds.

\lettersection{Why DR\"AXLMAIER?}
Dräxlmaier offers a chance to be part of a global and diverse company working at the bleeding edge of the automotive supply chain. The company provides a remarkable inter-disciplinary opportunity to further one's professional career by honing their skills across departments and collaborating with senior experts. The ability to advance my professional skills with Business Academy particularly appeals to me. The automotive industry is transitioning towards a green future made possible by a reliable and innovative supply chain, of which Dräxlmaier is an industry leader.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I believe I am an innovative thinker with strong communication and presentation skills capable of working according to a "big picture" while also holding in-depth subject-specific conversations. In my previous experiences, I have demonstrated the ability to identify the problem, break it into solvable chunks, engineer an actionable solution, and communicate with colleagues. My supervisors often appreciate my attitude and approach to problem-solving and value my contributions as high-quality.

\lettersection{}
I hope my application for the job is considered, as I continue to be very excited about the possibilities. Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can provide additional information.
