# TODO
- Font size adjustments (could be lowered?)
- Page numbers (in x/y format)
- experiment with fonts - raleway, museo sans (recommended for title), chaparral-pro (recommended for body), avenir
- Justify text (?)
- looks too cluttered right now
	- increase spacing (between lines and sections)
	- use dividers for sectioning (?)
